<h1>Parcours Académiques:</h1>
<p>"I initially earned a baccalaureate degree and a diploma in mechanical engineering,<br>
 which laid a robust foundation in the realm of mechanics. <br>
 Building upon this knowledge, I am currently pursuing studies in software engineering. <br>
 This transition reflects my evolving interests and a desire to broaden my skill set in the dynamic field of technology.<br>
 My background in mechanical engineering serves as a valuable base, complementing my present educational journey in software engineering. <br>
 The combination of these disciplines equips me with a diverse skill set and a multidimensional approach to problem-solving in both mechanical and software realms.<br></p>
